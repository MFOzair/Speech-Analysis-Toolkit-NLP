## **Features**

### **File Descriptions**

### **`president_helper.py`**  
This module provides utility functions for speech analysis:
- **`read_file(file_name)`**: Reads a speech file and returns its content.  
- **`process_speeches(speeches)`**: Preprocesses and tokenizes speeches into word-level tokens.  
- **`merge_speeches(speeches)`**: Merges sentences from multiple speeches into a single list.  
- **`get_president_sentences(president)`**: Retrieves tokenized sentences for a specific president.  
- **`get_presidents_sentences(presidents)`**: Retrieves tokenized sentences for multiple presidents.  
- **`most_frequent_words(list_of_sentences)`**: Returns the most frequently used words in the speeches.

### **`main_analysis.py`**
This script performs advanced analysis on speeches, including:
- Reading all presidential speech files in the directory.
- Preprocessing and tokenizing the speech data.
- Extracting the most frequent words across speeches.
- Training Word2Vec models for word embeddings.
- Analyzing word similarity:
  - Identifies words similar to "freedom" in all speeches.
  - Performs the same analysis for specific presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt or groups like the Mount Rushmore presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt).
